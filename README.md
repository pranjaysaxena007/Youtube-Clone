# Youtube Home Page Clone

A simple responsive clone of the YouTube home page built using only **HTML** and **CSS**, focusing on layout, styling, and pixel-perfect UI structure.

**Live Demo:** https://ps007-you-tube-demo.infinityfreeapp.com/

---

## Features

- Static clone of YouTube home feed layout (header, sidebar, video grid).
- Pure HTML and CSS implementation (no JavaScript, no frameworks).
- Responsive video card grid using modern CSS layout techniques.
- Reusable components for header icons, channel avatars, and thumbnails.

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML** - Structure and semantic layout
- **CSS** - Layout, responsiveness, and styling

## Folder Structure

```
Youtube-Clone/
├── youtube.html        # Main page markup
├── styles/             # CSS stylesheets
├── images/             # Video thumbnails and UI icons
├── channel_images/     # Channel avatar images
└── logo/               # Logo assets
```

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pranjaysaxena007/Youtube-Clone.git
   ```

2. **Open the main file in a browser:**
   ```bash
   cd Youtube-Clone
   # Double-click youtube.html OR
   # use any live server extension in VS Code
   ```

---

## How It Works

- The main layout is defined in `youtube.html`, including header, sidebar, and video grid sections.
- All styling (colors, spacing, typography, hover effects) is defined in the CSS files inside the `styles` folder.

---

## Possible Improvements

- Add JavaScript for interactive behavior (search bar, dropdowns, dynamic video loading).
- Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, better semantics).
- Enhance responsiveness for smaller screens and mobile devices.
- Add dark/light theme toggle.
- Implement video filtering and sorting functionality.
